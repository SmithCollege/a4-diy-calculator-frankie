The wiki on SYA was really helpful to break down infix to postfix

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

This is the first assignment I've felt like I've done independently. Usually I rely on office hours to get the brunt of my work done, with a lot of step by step help. But I was able to do most of the postfix function myself. I did need help debug a slight problem that I wouldn't have noticed by myself, but I had all the elements outside of that. I'm still a little lost on what the goal of the infix method is, so I wasn't able to get to that. I probably just missed when we discussed infix in class. But when I go back to do A2 I'll also revisit this assignment to finish it fully.


This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?

I had a sample problem I did step by step as a model. but i didn't take a photo.
